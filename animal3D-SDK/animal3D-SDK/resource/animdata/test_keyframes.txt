# This denotes a comment, any line beginning with this is ignored by the parser
# @ denotes a new keyframe declaration, like Dan's clip examples

# We could do a shortcut using <x, y, z> to create a keyframe for each coordinate channel, since 1 KF only has 1 value
# We could also do "x= " or "y= " or "z= " to determine what the value means
# But in the end, we choose what the value corresponds to when we evaluate the clip's current state

# @ keyframe_dur keyframe_index keyframe_value

@ 0.5 0 x=0
@ 1.0 1 x=2
@ 1.5 2 x=5
@ 2.0 3 x=1
